               <h5 class="aboutUs">
                    J&J Coin & Jewelry is a fine jewelry and collectible buying establishment that was founded in May of
                    2018 by two longtime friends, Jeremy and Jillian. Our core values are our honesty, dependability,
                    and flexibility to meet our customers' needs. We are confident that we will not be undersold and
                    that we will always pay the highest cash prices in New Jersey. We understand that it is difficult to
                    know who to trust in this competitive business, and our goal is to give our customers the confidence
                    that they are receiving the best price for their valuables. We specialize in buying coins, silver, gold, diamonds, platinum, watches, and silver sets; even broken and unwanted jewelry - we buy it all! We pay the highest CA$H prices New Jersey has to offer. We also sell silver, gold, and silver and gold bullion.
